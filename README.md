# Agency-Website-main
This is a practice website, in which I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create the front-end side of the website.

I recreated a design from cssauthor.com and made certain changes to the overal UI of the webpage.
This project was to mainly refresh myself on certain front-end developement skills.
I also for the first time started using JavaScript to integrate certain animations and standards of web design principles. To be exact, with the help of online resources I created a navigation menu animation, and toggle ability between dark mode (theme) and light mode (theme).
The webpage was also developed with general breakpoints/responsive guidelines so it may not work fully as intended on certain mobiles.

Overall it took around 20 hours to create this webpage.

UPDATE 3/7/2022
Added the blog page part of the website.
Used this page to practice some of the basics and fundamentals of CSS Grid.
Page should also be responsive for general devices.
