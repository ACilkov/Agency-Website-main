# Agency-Website-main
This is a practice website, in which I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create the front-end side of the website.

I recreated a design from cssauthor.com and made certain changes to the overal UI of the webpage.
This project was to mainly refresh myself on certain front-end developement skills.
I also for the first time started using JavaScript to integrate certain animations and standards of web design principles. To be exact, with the help of online resources I created a navigation menu animation, and toggle ability between dark mode (theme) and light mode (theme).
The webpage was also developed with general breakpoints/responsive guidelines so it may not work fully as intended on certain mobiles.

Overall it took around 20 hours to create this webpage.
